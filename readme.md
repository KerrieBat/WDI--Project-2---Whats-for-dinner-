# WDI Project 2
## What's for dinner? by Kerrie Bstrouney

#### A repository for storing, sharing, and discovering great dinner recipes.
---

### Overview
This app is designed to relieve the stress of feeding a demanding family every night.
Do you leave it until you are travelling home from work to start to wonder what's for dinner?
Every family has favourite recipes, these are by definition tasty and easy to make, otherwise you wouldn't make them so often! This app allows us to share our favourite recipes and easily access others. It is easy to upload your recipes, just take a photo of the recipe, no need for typing it in or fancy formatting. Uploaded recipes are categorised according to a number of options.
When searching for a meal idea for dinner, you can search by name or search by categories.
Users should be able to browse all submitted recipes with various filtering options, upvote, and 'star' their favourites.

### Future Development

I could have used a  lot more time to complete the project, there are things that need to be completed to allow designed functionality and there are many other add ons that I have thought of during the development.

1. Redo styling using Bootstrap so that it is cleaner and more responsive.
2. Get the select recipe by category part of the app working.
3. Add functionality so that a weeks worth of menus can be selected so that the shopping can be completed in advance
4. Add a carousel to display the recipe  options for the user to select one.
5. Display the photos in the correct orientation.
6. The abiltiy to flag favourite recipes so that these are the first displayed.
7. The ability for users to vote on recipes so those with the most votes float to the top.
